### Features

The following features are supported:

- [x] Collection minting: merchants can create and mint a new NFT collection inside the app so they don't have to go somewhere else for it.
- [x] Gated Content: merchants can offer a discount amount or percentage to owners of one or more collections, discounts are automatically applied if customer meets the requirements.
- [ ] Loyalty Programs: merchants can offer more than gated content, they can also offer customers post-purchase offers, like airdroping them an NFT after a purchase is made.
- [ ] Reward Coins: merchants can create their own token for their shop and use it as a rewarding system for customers, where they get an ammount of coins after each purchase; customers can later trade coins or redeem for promotions. Coins could also be accepted as a currency within the shop or other sites.
